Find out how event loops in JavaScript work, how React.useRef works and how it is different yet similar to React.useState, are Styled Components actually worth it and grease your React skills with an interesting quiz.

# Tip of the day
You can use placeholder commas in the beginning to skip elements while [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) an array. For instance you want to create a new array skipping the first two elements of another array, you can do it like this - 

```javascript
const superheroes = ['Hawkeye', 'Black widow', 'Thor', 'Wanda', 'Hulk', 'Iron man'];
const [, , ...awesomeHeroes] = superheroes;

console.log(awesomeHeroes);
// > ['Thor', 'Wanda', 'Hulk', 'Iron man'];
```

Explore with Ido why he had to migrate from using styled-components to Tailwind CSS for [daily.dev](https://daily.dev) despite him considering the former as having a better DX, and what does the future hold for such CSS-in-JS libraries. Fun fact - Scriptified is also built with Tailwind CSS.

# Quiz

### What is wrong with the below code snippet?

```jsx
// Assume this is some heavy component with some heavy tree
// Hence this component is memoized to avoid unnecessary re-renders
const SomeHeavyComponent = React.memo(
  ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>
);

const SomeComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <SomeHeavyComponent>
        <span>Header</span>
      </SomeHeavyComponent>

      Count: {count}

      <button 
        type="button" 
        onClick={() => setCount(currentCount => currentCount + 1)}
      >
        Increment count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<div style="margin: 12px 0px; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 16px; background: #F2F3F5;">
	`setCount` can only take number as an argument, causing the app to crash when count is incremented because it has been passed a function on Line 19
</div>
</a>

<a href="https://scriptified.dev/issues/3?section=quiz&option=2" style="text-decoration:none;">
<div style="margin: 12px 0px; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 16px; background: #F2F3F5;">
	The `SomeHeavyComponent` expects a `children={something}` prop which is missing on Line 11
</div>
</a>

<a href="https://scriptified.dev/issues/3?section=quiz&option=3" style="text-decoration:none;">
<div style="margin: 12px 0px; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 16px; background: #F2F3F5;">
	The `SomeHeavyComponent` won't be memoized because we need to pass `React.memo` a dependency array similar to the memoization hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
</div>
</a>

<a href="https://scriptified.dev/issues/3?section=quiz&option=4" style="text-decoration:none;">
<div style="margin: 12px 0px; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 16px; background: #F2F3F5;">
	The `SomeHeavyComponent` won't be memoized because `children` prop is new on every render of `SomeComponent`
</div>
</a>
